          <ul>
            <li>Shane Warne is widely regarded as one of the greatest spin bowlers in cricket history. He retired with 708 Test wickets, making him the second-highest wicket-taker in Test cricket history at the time of his retirement.</li>
            <li>In the 1993 Ashes series, Warne delivered the famous “Ball of the Century” to Mike Gatting. The delivery, which spun sharply to hit the stumps, showcased Warne’s exceptional skill and became one of the most iconic moments in cricket history.</li>
            <li>Warne played a pivotal role in Australia’s dominance in world cricket during the 1990s and early 2000s. He was instrumental in Australia’s victories in numerous Test series and One Day Internationals, including the 1999 Cricket World Cup.</li>
            <li>In 2000, Warne was named one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Century, a testament to his exceptional talent and impact on the game. This prestigious accolade recognized him as one of the top five cricketers of all time.</li>
            <li>Despite facing several injuries and controversies throughout his career, Warne made remarkable comebacks and continued to break records. He was the first bowler to reach 600 Test wickets and finished his career with 293 ODI wickets, showcasing his longevity and consistency at the highest level.</li>
          </ul>
